# Yahtzee-Game

Yahtzee is a dice game played with 5 dice where you try to score the most points by matching certain combinations. You can play the game [here](https://cardgames.io/yahtzee/). In Yahtzee, you get to roll the dice three times on each turn. After the first roll, you may hold as many dice as you would like and roll the remaining free dice. After this second roll, you may again hold as many dice as you would like and roll the rest. Once you stop (either because you have exhausted your three rolls or you are satisfied with the dice you have), you score the dice in one box on the score card.

My mini-project,  will implement a strategy function designed to help you choose which dice to hold after your second roll during the first turn of a game of Yahtzee.

Now, Impress your friends by consistently beating them at Yahtzee!
